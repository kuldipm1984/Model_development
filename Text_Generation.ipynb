This file format is considered legacy. We recommend using instead the native Keras format, e.g. `model.save('my_model.keras')` or `keras.saving.save_model(model, 'my_model.keras')`. \n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"iFLObKL_lfNy"},"source":["## Text Generation\n"],"id":"iFLObKL_lfNy"},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def generate_text(model, tokenizer, seq_len, seed_text, num_gen_words):\n","    '''\n","    INPUTS:\n","    model : model that was trained on text data\n","    tokenizer : tokenizer that was fit on text data\n","    seq_len : length of training sequence\n","    seed_text : raw string text to serve as the seed\n","    num_gen_words : number of words to be generated by model\n","    '''\n","\n","    # Final Output\n","    output_text = []\n","\n","    # Intial Seed Sequence\n","    input_text = seed_text\n","\n","    # Create num_gen_words\n","    for i in range(num_gen_words):\n","\n","        # Take the input text string and encode it to a sequence\n","        encoded_text = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences([input_text])[0]\n","\n","        # Pad sequences to our trained rate (50 words in the video)\n","        pad_encoded = pad_sequences([encoded_text], maxlen=seq_len, truncating='pre')\n","\n","        # Predict Class Probabilities for each word\n","        pred_word_ind = np.argmax(model.predict(pad_encoded, verbose=0), axis=-1)[0]\n","\n","        # Grab word\n","        pred_word = tokenizer.index_word[pred_word_ind]\n","\n","        # Update the sequence of input text (shifting one over with the new word)\n","        input_text += ' ' + pred_word\n","\n","        output_text.append(pred_word)\n","\n","    # Make it look like a sentence.\n","    return ' '.join(output_text)"],"metadata":{"id":"3JbGFhHE3L50","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1741614780267,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":7,"user":{"displayName":"Kuldip Mitra","userId":"09334071575411676230"}}},"id":"3JbGFhHE3L50","execution_count":12,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["seed_text= 'I asked to hide the Christmas Tree  and make sure the children did not see it until this evening.'"],"metadata":{"id":"DpXgZaun3R-P","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1741615299244,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":7,"user":{"displayName":"Kuldip Mitra","userId":"09334071575411676230"}}},"id":"DpXgZaun3R-P","execution_count":17,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["generate_text(model, tokenizer, seq_len, seed_text, num_gen_words=100)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":88},"id":"Opw24mpb3XZU","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1741615307724,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":6984,"user":{"displayName":"Kuldip Mitra","userId":"09334071575411676230"}},"outputId":"0ed401ba-390c-4697-cba4-ac5e1b5124bb"},"id":"Opw24mpb3XZU","execution_count":18,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'i shall be valiant been and to be off in other christmas sobbing to stay on its wings of the bank and you used to look into my end at the words its all and very nearly forgotten to give us said the king and she can none the dear false and she went on said the gryphon youll be telling you about her change you used to the dewdropping man with cats nothing two long how did my mother the next difficulty again what was nothing about the letter and of tears and if i had the same scenethe'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":18}]}],"metadata":{"accelerator":"GPU","colab":{"gpuType":"T4","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
